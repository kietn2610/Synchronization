# Synchronization
Operating System Group Project 2

This project requires implementing a solution to this problem using either POSIX mutex locks and condition variables or Java condition variables.


Both implementations will entail generating five philosophers, each numbered 0 through 4. Each philosopher will run as an individual thread, and they alternate between thinking and eating. To simulate these activities, each thread should sleep for a random duration between one and three seconds.
